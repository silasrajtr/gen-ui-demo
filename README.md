This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).





## Getting Started

NOTE: This project is under development. But you can see a simple working prototype.

First clone the repo using,
```bash
git clone https://github.com/silasrajtr/gen-ui-demo.git
```
Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
## API Provider

This project currently uses the **Groq API** for running LLMs. 

To get a free Groq api key - [click here](https://groq.com/).

Refer to `.env.example` and create a `.env.local` file inside the root folder, paste the groq api key to the `GROQ_API_KEY` variable and you're good to go.

If you want to switch to any other [provider](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/foundations/providers-and-models) instead, you can update the code for [streamText](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text#streamtext) in the below file.

```
gen-ui-demo/app/api/chat/route.ts
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## What this project is all about.
This repo shows a basic generative UI implementation using AI SDK. While in action, this chatbot looks out for unclear or low-context prompts and turns them into question-options that show up as clickable UI components.  


This is what I mean by *generating question-options as clickable UI components* ðŸ‘‡  


See this example of a question with poor context and how humans naturally respond when missing details:


`How can I get a job?`
```
  We'll think of questions like:

      - Job, in which domain?
      
      - Which type, Full-time, Part-time, or an Internship?
      
      - What are the skills you have?
      
      - Do you have a company in mind?

```


Now, hereâ€™s the funny part:  
Chatbots nowadays carry this **burden of giving the perfect response on the very first try.** So most of the time, they shoot back something like:


```
Thatâ€™s awesome!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ”¥, Hereâ€™s what you can do right now:

âœ… Polish up your resume so it really shines.

âœ… Get your LinkedIn and other profiles active and engaging.

âœ… Start applying consistentlyâ€”momentum is key.
```



Sometimes chatbots do ask things back. But then we have to type the response again to guide them.  

> This is *token intensive* and *time consuming.*


My approach is a little different. 

Instead of wasting cycles, I make the agent check for ambiguity in user inputs and trigger an `interactiveQuestionTool`. This tool generates a question with multiple options and sends it to the front-end.  

The front-end then shows it as a quiz-like interactive UI component where the user just clicks instead of typing.  

This way, itâ€™s faster, cheaper, and way more intuitive. Thatâ€™s the whole idea of Generative UI powered by AI SDK.  

**TL;DR**  


Instead of forcing chatbots to guess or making users type long clarifications, this project makes the bot detect ambiguity and auto-generate multiple-choice style questions. The user just clicks â†’ faster, cheaper, and more natural. Thatâ€™s Generative UI with AI SDK.  

**NOTE:**

There's a room for improvement on my working demo and I'm working on it. like:
- Total UI. Everything!
- Multiple options selection.
- Include a free-text field below the choices in case none of them feel relatable to the user.
